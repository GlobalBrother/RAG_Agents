## Task 2 – 120‑Word Ad Script (Word count: 119)

This is a weed.  
Think it’s useless? Think again.  

I’m Dr. Nicole Apelian, herbalist and author of The Forgotten Home Apothecary, and I’m here to open your eyes.  

Over 30 years of working with plants and traditional healers…  

I’ve discovered simple remedies that can help you calm joint stiffness…  
soothe anxious thoughts…  
support your liver and digestion…  
and even help your body fight off stubborn bugs.  

The surprising part?  

Many of these remedies start with “junk” plants growing in your yard… or herbs sitting in your kitchen.  

Inside my 320‑page book, I show you exactly what to use, how to make it, and how much to take.  

Click to see the plants most people ignore.

## Task 3 – Scene‑by‑Scene Storyboard

**Scene 1:**  
[Visual direction]  
Close‑up of a “common weed” (dandelion or plantain) being held between a woman’s fingers. Natural light, slight breeze. No face yet, just the plant filling the frame. Ambient outdoor sounds, no music yet. Camera holds steady.  
[Script line]  
“This is a weed.”

**Scene 2:**  
[Visual direction]  
Same shot, the hand tilts the weed; a subtle text overlay appears bottom‑left: “The Forgotten Home Apothecary.” Soft, curious music fades in.  
[Script line]  
“Think it’s useless? Think again.”

**Scene 3:**  
[Visual direction]  
Cut to Dr. Nicole Apelian seated at a wooden kitchen table filled with jars of dried herbs and a copy of the book. Warm, natural lighting. She’s a woman in her 50s, casual shirt and cardigan, relaxed posture, friendly but direct tone. She looks into the camera.  
[Script line]  
“I’m Dr. Nicole Apelian, herbalist and author of The Forgotten Home Apothecary, and I’m here to open your eyes.”

**Scene 4:**  
[Visual direction]  
Slow pan as she stands in front of shelves lined like an apothecary: labeled jars, droppers, small bowls. She gently runs her hand along the jars while speaking.  
[Script line]  
“Over 30 years of working with plants and traditional healers…”

**Scene 5:**  
[Visual direction]  
Quick cuts:  
– Close‑up of someone rubbing a stiff knee.  
– Nicole pouring a dark tincture into a spoon.  
– A teacup with steam rising.  
Calm background music continues.  
[Script line]  
“I’ve discovered simple remedies that can help you calm joint stiffness…”

**Scene 6:**  
[Visual direction]  
Cut to a woman sitting on a couch, taking a slow breath, sipping herbal tea. Room is cozy, evening light from a lamp.  
[Script line]  
“…soothe anxious thoughts…”

**Scene 7:**  
[Visual direction]  
Cut to a cutting board: lemon, garlic, and a jar of yellowish tonic. Nicole’s hands add herbs into a jar. Overhead shot.  
[Script line]  
“…support your liver and digestion…”

**Scene 8:**  
[Visual direction]  
Macro shot of a dropper bottle labeled “Immune Support.” A drop falls into a glass of water.  
[Script line]  
“…and even help your body fight off stubborn bugs.”

**Scene 9:**  
[Visual direction]  
Return to Nicole at the table, leaning in slightly toward camera, elbows lightly on the table, book in front of her. Music softens.  
[Script line]  
“The surprising part?”

**Scene 10:**  
[Visual direction]  
Split‑second cuts:  
– Dandelions in a lawn.  
– Plantain between sidewalk cracks.  
– Common kitchen herbs on a counter (oregano, thyme).  
Natural, bright lighting.  
[Script line]  
“Many of these remedies start with ‘junk’ plants growing in your yard… or herbs sitting in your kitchen.”

**Scene 11:**  
[Visual direction]  
Medium shot: Nicole opens The Forgotten Home Apothecary to a full‑color remedy page. Camera slowly zooms in on clear step‑by‑step photos and bold headings. Her fingertip traces down the page.  
[Script line]  
“Inside my 320‑page book, I show you exactly what to use, how to make it, and how much to take.”

**Scene 12:**  
[Visual direction]  
Final shot: The book standing upright on the table, a few common plants and a teacup beside it. Overlay text: “Discover the remedies hiding in plain sight” and a clickable-style button graphic: “Learn More.” Music ends on a soft, resolved note.  
[Script line]  
“Click to see the plants most people ignore.”

## Task 4 – Curiosity Check

- Opens with a pattern interrupt (“This is a weed.” → “Think again.”).  
- Implies there are useful “junk” plants people walk past daily.  
- Hints at multiple problems (joint stiffness, anxiety, liver, digestion, “stubborn bugs”) without naming exact plants or recipes.  
- Promises that these solutions are already nearby but hidden in plain sight.  
- Ends with: “Click to see the plants most people ignore,” which creates an open loop and motivates the viewer to click to discover which plants and remedies she means.
