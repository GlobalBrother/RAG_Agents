## 120-Word Ad Script (counted: 119 words)

This is a weed from my backyard.

Most people step on it or spray it.

My name is Dr. Nicole Apelian. I’m a herbalist and survival skills instructor, and this “weed” helped me get out of a wheelchair when multiple sclerosis had me bedbound.

Over 30 years, from university labs to the Kalahari Desert, I’ve tested plants like this on real people with real problems: parasites, joint stiffness, stress, brain fog, blood pressure, hair loss and more.

In my book, The Forgotten Home Apothecary, I show you 250 simple remedies you can make at home with plants you probably walk past every day.

If you want a home apothecary instead of a crowded medicine cabinet, watch this.

## Scene‑by‑Scene Storyboard

**Scene 1**  
[Visual direction]  
Close-up of a woman’s hand (no face yet) holding a small green “weed” with roots and a bit of soil. Outdoor, soft natural light, faint birds in background. Camera locked, shallow depth of field. No music yet, just ambient sound.  
[Script line]  
“This is a weed from my backyard.”

---

**Scene 2**  
[Visual direction]  
Same weed dropped on a concrete path. A shoe steps near it, then a spray bottle mist crosses the frame. Quick slow-motion as spray hits leaves. Light whoosh sound. Subtle, calm background music begins, minimal piano. Hard cut.  
[Script line]  
“Most people step on it or spray it.”

---

**Scene 3**  
[Visual direction]  
Cut indoors to Nicole at a wooden kitchen table. Warm daylight, plants and mason jars behind her, a worn field guide and notebook nearby. Lower-third text: “Dr. Nicole Apelian – Herbalist & Survival Instructor.” She’s mid‑40s, casual flannel shirt, relaxed posture, steady eye contact. Camera at eye level, gentle push‑in.  
[Script line]  
“My name is Dr. Nicole Apelian. I’m a herbalist and survival skills instructor, and this ‘weed’ helped me get out of a wheelchair when multiple sclerosis had me bedbound.”

**Scene 4**  
[Visual direction]  
Montage:  
• Nicole in an old lab photo (or tasteful reenactment) looking into a microscope.  
• Cut to her in Kalahari-style camp with Indigenous teachers (non‑identifiable or licensed B‑roll), studying plants.  
• Cut back to her gently harvesting leaves into a basket.  
Soft, steady music continues. No camera shake, smooth cuts.  
[Script line]  
“Over 30 years, from university labs to the Kalahari Desert, I’ve tested plants like this on real people with real problems: parasites, joint stiffness, stress, brain fog, blood pressure, hair loss and more.”

**Scene 5**  
[Visual direction]  
Medium shot at the kitchen table. Nicole opens a thick, 320‑page book titled “The Forgotten Home Apothecary.” Camera tilts down slightly as she flips through pages showing large color photos, clear layouts. Quick insert shots of remedies labeled “Parasites,” “Joint Comfort,” “Calm & Sleep,” “Cold & Flu.” Light page‑turn sounds.  
[Script line]  
“In my book, The Forgotten Home Apothecary, I show you 250 simple remedies you can make at home with plants you probably walk past every day.”

---

**Scene 6**  
[Visual direction]  
Close-up of the open book on the table like an old apothecary shelf: neat rows of jars in the background, ingredients and tools laid out. Nicole’s hand points to a recipe, then rests on the page. Camera slowly pulls back to a medium shot of her looking into camera, calm and confident. Music softens, slight pause before last line.  
[Script line]  
“If you want a home apothecary instead of a crowded medicine cabinet, watch this.”

**Curiosity Check**

- The “weed from my backyard” that helped with MS and many common issues (parasites, joint stiffness, brain fog, etc.) creates a strong “what is this plant?” tension.  
- Mention of 250 home remedies with plants people “probably walk past every day” builds intrigue about overlooked cures.  
- The final line invites viewers to “watch this” to learn how to turn backyard plants into a working home apothecary, pushing the click without revealing specific remedies.
