**Source type:** Study / News coverage  
**Source info:**  
- Study: “Ultra-processed food intake and risk of incident depression among adults in the U.S.” – JAMA Network Open, Sept 20, 2024  
- Coverage: “Eating lots of ultra-processed foods might increase risk of depression, study finds” – CNN Health, Sept 20, 2024  

**One-sentence summary:**  
A large study of over 30,000 adults found that people who ate the most ultra‑processed foods had a higher risk of developing depression, especially when they also consumed a lot of artificially sweetened drinks.

**Why it’s interesting NOW for women 55+ in the US:**  
Mood changes, low motivation, and “feeling off” are common complaints in this age group, and many are already worried about processed foods; this study gives them a timely, concrete reason to look for more natural, homemade options. It opens the door to mood-supporting teas, calming tinctures, and simple “kitchen apothecary” recipes that replace packaged snacks and drinks.

**Connection to The Forgotten Home Apothecary (Rule 2):**  
This segues naturally into making gentle, mood-supportive remedies at home—like relaxing evening teas, nervous-system-soothing tinctures, and uplifting tonics—using herbs and pantry ingredients instead of ultra‑processed products, and stocking a home apothecary with simple “comfort” formulas.

**Compliance check:**  
No disease cure promises needed; we can focus on emotional balance, calm, and support. Approved.

### AD 1 – Ultra‑Processed Food & Mood Hook

Scientists just linked heavy ultra‑processed food intake with a higher risk of depression…especially when people also drank lots of diet drinks.

If you’ve noticed your mood dipping as the pantry fills with boxes and bottles, this might hit close to home.

One quiet way many women are responding?

Building a tiny “mood shelf” in their kitchen: jars of calming tea blends, simple tinctures, and comfort tonics they can mix up in minutes.

In The Forgotten Home Apothecary, Dr. Nicole Apelian shows how to make these kinds of gentle, plant-based supports with herbs, spices, and real food you likely already buy.

**One-sentence summary:**  
Researchers found that regular short daytime naps were linked to slightly larger brain volume and better thinking skills, suggesting naps may help protect brain health as we age.

**Why it’s interesting NOW for women 55+:**  
Memory slips, word-finding issues, and “brain fog” are everyday worries; many already feel guilty about needing a rest. This turns napping into a positive, science-backed habit and makes people curious about other simple, natural ways to support their brain.

**Connection to The Forgotten Home Apothecary:**  
Perfect lead‑in to gentle memory and focus supports—like rosemary for clarity, circulation-supporting herbs, and “brain tonics” that can be sipped before or after a nap—organized like a little cognitive-support corner in a home apothecary.

**Compliance check:**  
We talk about maintaining clarity and focus, not preventing disease. Approved.

### AD 2 – Naps & Brain Hook

A new study just linked regular short naps with healthier brain volume and sharper thinking in older adults.

So that “guilty” afternoon doze? It might actually be doing your brain a favor.

Many women are now pairing a 20‑minute rest with simple, at‑home brain supporters: a cup of rosemary‑mint tea, a gentle circulation tonic, or a focus blend kept ready on the counter.

In The Forgotten Home Apothecary, you’ll find step‑by‑step recipes for memory and clarity‑supporting teas, tinctures, and tonics—plus how to stock them on a single kitchen shelf.

- Article: “What to know about parasites and food safety this summer” – NPR, July 3, 2024  

**One-sentence summary:**  
Doctors are warning that parasites aren’t just a “developing world” problem—contaminated produce, undercooked foods, and travel can expose Americans to unwanted gut guests without obvious symptoms.

**Why it’s interesting NOW for women 55+:**  
Many in this group travel, garden, and eat more salads to “eat healthy,” yet rarely think about parasites; the idea that you can feel bloated, itchy, or just “off” from a hidden gut visitor is both unsettling and highly curiosity‑provoking.

**Connection to The Forgotten Home Apothecary:**  
This dovetails into traditional, gentle gut‑supporting and cleansing approaches—like herbal parasite flush blends, bitters, and black walnut–based drops—made in small batches at home and kept on hand as part of a regular seasonal “gut check” ritual.

**Compliance check:**  
We avoid “kills parasites” language and focus on traditional use and gut comfort support. Approved.

### AD 3 – Hidden Parasites Hook

Doctors are quietly reminding people this year that parasites aren’t just something you pick up overseas.

They can ride in on raw veggies, undercooked foods, even that “healthy” salad mix…often leaving you with vague gut discomfort and feeling unlike yourself.

That’s why many herbalists still keep a small “gut shelf” in their home: gentle bitters, traditional parasite‑flush blends, and black walnut–based drops they make in tiny batches.

In The Forgotten Home Apothecary, Dr. Nicole Apelian walks you through a classic herbal parasite flush, black walnut preparations, and other gut‑supporting recipes step by step.

If the idea of hidden “guests” makes you uneasy, you may want to see how women are quietly supporting their digestion at home.

**Connection to The Forgotten Home Apothecary:**  
Perfect bridge to “Amish Ibuprofen”–style herbal blends, topical salves, and kitchen‑spice formulas that many people use to support normal inflammation and everyday comfort, stored together on a pain‑relief shelf in a home apothecary.

**Compliance check:**  
We position herbs as supportive, not replacements or cures. Approved.

### AD 4 – Pain Reliever Risk Hook

The FDA just reminded older adults that frequent use of common pain pills can stress the stomach, kidneys, and even the heart over time.

If you reach for a bottle most days just to keep moving, that’s hard to ignore.

Many women are now adding a second layer of support: simple herbal pain and comfort blends they make themselves and keep in a single kitchen basket.

In The Forgotten Home Apothecary, you’ll see exactly how Dr. Nicole Apelian puts together her “Amish Ibuprofen”–style formula, soothing salves, and warming spice blends using everyday herbs.

**Why it’s interesting NOW for women 55+:**  
Smoke and poor air have become a yearly reality across much of the US; women in this age group feel it in their chest and energy quickly and are actively looking for gentle ways to soothe and support their lungs.

**Connection to The Forgotten Home Apothecary:**

**Compliance check:**  
We speak about comfort and support during poor air days, not treatment of disease. Approved.

### AD 5 – Wildfire Smoke & Lung Hook

Health experts now talk about “smoke season” the way we talk about “flu season.”

They’re urging older adults to have a lung plan ready before the next wave of haze rolls in.

For many women, that now includes a little lung corner in the kitchen: jars of mullein‑thyme tea, a homemade chest rub, and simple steam herbs they bring out when the air turns gray.

In The Forgotten Home Apothecary, you’ll find step‑by‑step recipes for lung‑supportive teas and rubs, plus a liver detox section many people pair with smoky days.

**One-sentence summary:**  
Dermatologists say much everyday hair thinning in women is tied to stress, nutrient gaps, and hormonal shifts rather than rare diseases, and they highlight diet and lifestyle as part of a broader support plan.

**Why it’s interesting NOW for women 55+:**  
Hair shedding and a widening part are deeply emotional issues; hearing that food, herbs, and stress support may play a role gives a sense of agency and makes nourishing, home‑made formulas very appealing.

**Connection to The Forgotten Home Apothecary:**  
Opens the door to mineral‑rich infusions, scalp oils, stress-soothing teas, and circulation‑supporting tonics women can make and store together as a “hair and hormones” nook in their home apothecary.

**Compliance check:**  
We avoid promises about regrowth and focus on nourishment and support. Approved.

### AD 6 – Hair Thinning & Nutrients Hook
