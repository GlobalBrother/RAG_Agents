### Task #3: The 5 Candidate Hooks

**Hook 1: The "Golden Paste" Absorption Problem**
*   **Source Type:** Nutrition Research / Health News
*   **Source Info:** *Various recent studies on Curcumin bioavailability (e.g., Nutrition Reviews, recent health blogs), ongoing 2024 discussions.*
*   **Summary:** Taking plain turmeric powder or capsules does almost nothing because the body eliminates it too fast without specific "activator" fats and spices.
*   **Why interesting NOW:** Women 55+ buy turmeric in droves for joint stiffness. Learning they might be wasting money because they are missing one ingredient is a huge pattern interrupt.

**Hook 2: The Rosemary "Brain Boost" Scent**
*   **Source Type:** Clinical Study / Psychology News
*   **Source Info:** *Northumbria University research (re-circulating in natural health media, late 2023/early 2024)*.
*   **Summary:** The aroma of rosemary essential oil can significantly enhance memory retention and cognitive performance in older adults.
*   **Why interesting NOW:** Cognitive decline is a top fear for this demographic. A simple, non-invasive "smell test" remedy is low-friction and highly fascinating.

**Hook 3: Acetaminophen & Liver Load**
*   **Source Type:** Medical News / Safety Alerts
*   **Source Info:** *Ongoing FDA updates and hepatology reports regarding liver toxicity from long-term APAP use.*
*   **Summary:** Frequent use of common OTC pain relievers puts massive stress on the liver, prompting a search for gentler alternatives.
*   **Why interesting NOW:** This audience often takes daily pain relief. They are health-conscious and terrified of damaging their organs with chemicals.

**Hook 4: The "Onion Sock" Revival**
*   **Source Type:** Social Media Trend (TikTok/Instagram)
*   **Source Info:** *Viral #NaturalRemedies trends (Winter 2023/2024).*
*   **Summary:** Influencers and grandmothers alike are sharing the old folk remedy of sleeping with onions in socks to draw out toxins and support immune response during flu season.
*   **Why interesting NOW:** It sounds crazy, but it’s nostalgic. It validates "old wives' tales" that this generation grew up hearing about.

**Hook 5: The "Hidden Tenant" (Gut Health & Cravings)**
*   **Source Type:** Functional Medicine Podcasts
*   **Source Info:** *Discussions on the gut-brain axis and parasitic impact on sugar cravings (e.g., The Doctor’s Farmacy or similar genre, recent episodes).*
*   **Summary:** Unexplained fatigue and intense sugar cravings are often not a lack of willpower, but signs of unwanted microscopic "guests" in the gut.
*   **Why interesting NOW:** It shifts the blame from personal failure (eating sugar) to an external cause (parasites), offering a relief-based solution.
