### Task #7: The Winning Ad Selection

**The Winner: Ad Variant 2 - The "Amish Amoxicillin" (Antibiotic Shortages)**

**Why this is the winner:**
1.  **Urgency & Context:** The hook leverages the very real and current anxiety regarding medication shortages and effectiveness (superbugs).

3.  **Audience Fit:** The 55+ demographic values self-reliance and remembers "the old days" fondy. The reference to "born before 1970" acts as a perfect qualifying filter that builds instant rapport.
